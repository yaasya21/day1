# GitHub

**GitHub** is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Storing your code in a repository on GitHub allows you to:

- Showcase or share your work.
- Track and manage changes to your code over time.
- Let others review your code, and make suggestions to improve it.
- Collaborate on a shared project, without worrying that your changes will impact the work of your collaborators before you're ready to integrate them.
- Collaborative working, one of GitHubâ€™s fundamental features, is made possible by the open-source software, Git, upon which GitHub is built.
